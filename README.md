# To-Do List
## An Odin Project Exercise
### Redone in React

I was never quite satisfied with how this project turned out, and some cursory testing on re-visiting it found some pretty egregious bugs. I'm pretty much redoing from scratch - thiswill be interesting because the original project relied on an internal representation of the content as a list of objects holding lists full of objects, so translating that to React should prove educational.
